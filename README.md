# Quantopian-Algo-for-bear-market

This algorithm comes from my personal profile on Quantopian. Inspired by the Covid-19 economic crysis, It was thought to perform in a bear market, minimizing the risk mainly through a strong fundamental analysis. For this reason the Algo is more suitable for investing rather than trading. Please credit Alessandro Gussoni and this profile for any usage of the code
